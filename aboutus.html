      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <div class="about">Brian's Bean Shop is a small business that was founded in 2003 by a man named Brian Bean. 
      Brian Bean was a 23 year old office clerk living in the heart of New York City. One day Brian went on a business
      trip to Boston, Massachusetts, and during the short time there, fell in love with the bean-oriented community
      and business. Brian Bean left his job as an office clerk and moved to Hawaii to pursue a new life as a bean distributer.
      Brian's Bean Shop started off slow but has gained much traction in recent years.</div>
